FIXME:
- Problem with encoding (check your UTF8 newb!)
- DOMString[] vs DOMString, why even in Moz Wiki, DOMString[] receives a simple DOMString? [1]
- Address vs Street vs Street 1 vs Street 2

TODO:
- Design (schniarf, screunf, schniouf !)
- Other import formats
- Find a more suitable icon (nice, not a pixel-crapy-thing to resize)
